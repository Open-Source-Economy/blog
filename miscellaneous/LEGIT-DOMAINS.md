# Why this email looks a bit suspicious (but isnâ€™t)

Hello security-minded reader ðŸ‘‹

If youâ€™re here, it probably means you noticed something odd:  
the email domain we used to reach out to you doesnâ€™t quite match our website.  
Good catch â€” youâ€™d make an excellent security engineer.

So letâ€™s clear things up.

## Who we are

We are **a Swiss non-profit dedicated to making open source more sustainable**.

Unfortunately, noble ideals alone donâ€™t keep the ecosystem truly independent and sustainable, nor do they guarantee community needs are met.

To give open source the future it deserves, we sometimes have to useâ€¦ well, *business sales tragedy* tactics. Yes, that means different email domains.  
Think of it as a necessary evil in service of a greater good.

## The legit domains

If you get an email from us, itâ€™s safe as long as it comes from one of these:

- `@opensource-economy.org` â†’ our main non-profit domain
- `@oss-economy.com`
- `@economy-open-source.com`
- `@economy-opensource.com`
- `@economy-oss.com`
- `@foss-economy.co`
- `@foss-economy.com`
- `@foss-economy.org`
- `@free-economy-opensource.com`
- `@nextopensourceeconomy.co`
- `@nextopensourceeconomy.com`
- `@nextopensourceeconomy.org`
- `@open-sourceeconomy.com`
- `@opensourceeconomy.co`
- `@oss-economy.co`
- `@oss-economy.org`
- `@open-source-economy.com`

If itâ€™s not on this listâ€¦ itâ€™s not us. Report it, or frame it as a collectorâ€™s item.

## Final note

We know â€” juggling multiple domains feels messy.  
But hey, if using a few sales-y tricks helps us channel more funding back into open source,  
then the ends justify the domains.

Because at the end of the day,  
our only real agenda is: **making free and open source sustainable.**
