# A paradigm shift from software to services

- Users run the software on their computer and save their data on their local storage
- Users run services on their device, through web or phone apps, and their data is saved in the cloud

# What makes a service

- Software on the server
- Software on the browser or on a mobile device
- Storage in the cloud

# The trend towards "apps"

- Since javascript, software can run inside browsers when a user accesses a service
- Running software on end user devices relieves the server from part of the data processing
- Apps become heavier, and servers slim down and tend to become just storage

# What is "free" and what is not

- There are lots of open source components running both on servers and clients
- Service specific parts are often proprietary, though some services are open source and can be installed on premise
- Services still need servers to run, basically to store users' data
- Many economic models leverage personal data to create income
- Part of this income is needed to run the servers, ie to store users' data

# The need for a "free storage"

- To have free services the same way we have free software, we miss a "free storage"
